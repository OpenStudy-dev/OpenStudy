"""Tests for app/services/events.py.

Events are the activity log: insert-only, ordered by created_at desc.
The schema has no FK requirement on `kind`, but `course_code` is a soft
FK (`ON DELETE SET NULL`) — so a referenced course must exist if supplied.

Note: the baseline schema has triggers (`trg_log_change_*`) that
auto-insert events on every mutation of `courses`, `tasks`, etc. These
tests use unique `kind` labels (prefixed `evt:test:*`) and filter by
kind so the trigger-generated rows from other tests don't pollute results.
